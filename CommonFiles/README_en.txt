Dependencies for Qt5 in Ubuntu:
Until someone (maybe me) build packages you should install them manually :(

libqt5printsupport5
libqt5widgets5
libqt5sql5
libqt5sql5-mysql
libqt5script5
libqt5network5
libqt5xml5
libqt5gui5
libqt5core5a

To run application under Linux use "Launch RepairCenter.sh" and "Launch QtRptDesigner.sh",
also you can copy "libQtZint.so.1" to /usr/lib and run executables directly.

Hey, guys, i need some help!
As you can see my english is bad and pretty much google-translated, so i need help with english translation,
especially in professional slang or country-specific terms and printable forms.
Then I can make all the fields in the source code English.
