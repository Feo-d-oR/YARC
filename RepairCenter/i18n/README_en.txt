Dependencies for Qt5 in Ubuntu:
Until someone (maybe me) build packages you should install them manually :(

libqt5printsupport5
libqt5widgets5
libqt5sql5
libqt5sql5-mysql
libqt5script5
libqt5network5
libqt5xml5
libqt5gui5
libqt5core5a

Also you should copy contents of "lib" folder to /usr/lib.

Hey, guys, i need come help!
As you can see my english is bad and pretty much google-translated, so i need help with english translation,
especially in professional slang/country-specific items and printable forms.
Then I can make all the fields in the source code English.
